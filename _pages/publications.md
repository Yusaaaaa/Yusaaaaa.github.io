- **Interaction-enhanced many-body localization in a 1D quasiperiodic model with long-range hopping** [arXiv:2501.04466](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04466 "arXiv:2501.04466")
  We study the many-body localization (MBL) transition in a 1D exactly solvable system with long-range hopping and quasiperiodic on-site potential introduced in Phys. Rev. Lett. 131, 186303 (2023). Unlike other disorder or   quasiperiodic model, an interaction-enhanced MBL happens in the moderate interaction regime, which is dubbed as the interaction-enhanced MBL. This counterintuitive phenomenon can be understood by noticing the fragility of the critical band lying at the bottom of the spectrum. The fragile band is localized by other localized states once the interaction is turned on. This mechanism can be verified by introducing a mean-field theory description which can derive highly excited states with high accuracy. The effectiveness of this mean-field theory is captured by the quasihole physics, validated by the particle entanglement spectra.
